# Bluetooth-Voting-System

In this project I have created an android application that works as a voting system and utilises Bluetooth for establishing a connection between Server (Mobile A) and Receiver (Mobile B). This model can be used to cast votes in remote areas where establishing a strong internet connection is difficult.

This project is developed using Android Studio and the languages used are java and xml. In this project we use two android smartphones for our voting system. Device A is used for the voters to login using their username and password. After entering the correct login details, they votes must select the candidate they want to vote for and click on the vote icon. Device B is used to display the result.
